        <p>Rain and snowmelt: When rain or snowmelt accumulates faster than the soil can absorb it or rivers can carry it away, flooding can occur. 
            Ice jams: Melting snow and warm rain can break the ice that forms on rivers and streams, causing ice jams that can lead to flash flooding. 
            Storm surges: Storm surges associated with tropical cyclones can cause coastal flooding. 
            Tsunamis: Tsunamis can cause coastal flooding. 
            Urbanization: Rapid urban development can reduce the amount of natural land that can absorb rainfall, increasing the risk of flooding. 
            Water control structure failure: Failure of a water control structure, such as a levee or dam, can lead to flooding. 
            Greenhouse gases: The increase in greenhouse gases due to industrial impacts, pollution, and burning fossil fuels is a major source of man-made flooding. 
            Heavy sediment load: When rivers carry a heavy sediment load from catchments, it can lead to flooding, erosion, and drainage congestion
